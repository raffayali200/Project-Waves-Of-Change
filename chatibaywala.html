      <p class="text-gray-700">
      <p>The Cha Tibay Wala Village Water Drive was the second successful initiative under the Waves of Change campaign. Located in the Kot Addu Tehsil of Muzaffargarh District, Cha Tibay Wala is an agricultural village nestled near the Indus River. Despite being surrounded by water sources, the local community lacked direct access to clean drinking water for years.</p>

      <p>The local population, especially women and children, faced daily challenges in collecting water from distant and often contaminated sources. This not only impacted their physical health but also consumed time that could have been used for education, income generation, or care work.</p>

      <p>After surveying the village and engaging with local leaders, the team installed a durable, manually operated hand pump in the home of Shahida Bibi. This site was chosen for its accessibility to surrounding families and proximity to the village center. The pump serves over 8 family members directly and benefits many more indirectly within the community.</p>

      <p>Local labor was employed during the installation, ensuring community participation and economic support. The hand pump was constructed with reinforced concrete and a proper drainage solution to maintain hygiene and long-term usability.</p>

      <p>Since the pump was installed, the positive changes have been immediate and measurable. Residents now have safe water on demand, reducing the risk of waterborne diseases and improving daily routines. The children in the area, once burdened with fetching water, now have more time for school and play.</p>

      <p>This project reaffirms our mission — to restore dignity and basic human rights through clean water access. The Cha Tibay Wala hand pump is more than a water source — it’s a symbol of progress, resilience, and shared humanity.</p>
