        <p><strong>Economy:</strong> Muridkay’s economy is mainly based on agriculture, with many villagers engaged in farming. The fertile soil supports the cultivation of crops such as wheat, rice, and various fruits and vegetables.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-700">
        The Muridkay Village Water Drive marked the first successful hand pump installation under the Waves of Change campaign. Lambray, a small settlement near the city of Sheikhupura, had limited access to clean drinking water for years. Families relied on distant or shared sources, often exposing them to waterborne diseases and long treks—especially challenging for children and the elderly.
      </p>

      <p>
        After evaluating the site, our team identified a home centrally located to serve surrounding households. The hand pump installation was carried out using high-quality, locally sourced materials and with the help of local labor to ensure sustainability and community involvement.
      </p>

      <p>
        The pump has improved the quality of life for over 7 family members directly and supports others in the community. It has reduced illness, saved time, and contributed to a more hygienic environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        This project has laid the foundation for future initiatives and shown that even a single water pump can bring dignity, health, and hope to an entire community.
